4.0
- Not an actual build, it's a turning point on the codebase, full rewrite
- The coremod is divided into 2 modules: Loader and Mod
- The Loader module, having a fixed version, acts as bootloader for the Mod, downloading the latest build artifact if needed (auto-update)
- Both modules are expected to not use any minecraft source code directly, ASM is used for that purpose

3.26 -> 3.37
- This build line is doomed, needs full overhaul

3.25
- Small mistake on SQL string (forgot to remove extra comma)
- Fixed auto-updater not deleting old jar

3.24
- Removed URL check for cached (existing) player skin/cape links

3.23
- Auto-update works now
- Added a condition to prevent the server-side from auto-updating and screwing itself

3.13 -> 3.22
- Implemented URL checks for skin and cape links, defaulting to Mojang (aka premium) on invalid
- Caching mechanism (forums -> AADB.players) was overhauled

3.1 -> 3.12
- 3.X legacy versions

2.X
- Idealized, but not implemented

1.X
- Initial proof of concept
